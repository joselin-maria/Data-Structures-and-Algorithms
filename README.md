# What is DSA?
DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics â€“ Data Structure and Algorithms.
A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. 
Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform a specific type of calculation.
